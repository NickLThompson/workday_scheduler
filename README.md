## Description

This is a website that will allow you to save upcoming events

and reminders in the allotted time slot by typing the information

into the text boxes. The website is supposed to highlight the current

time in red, the past times in grey, and the future times in green.

When clicking the save button, the website will save your information

typed in the localStorage and console areas respectively.

## Usage

The purpose of this website is to allow the user to keep tabs on current

and upcomings events. Basically, a calendar website. It is also supposed

to show the current date and time at the top of the screen along with the

color-coded textboxes showing the current time.

## Status

This project really feels like it's so close but so far at the same time. I have 

so much written and my usage of .inBetween is, in my opinion, pretty well done; The

problem is that I could not figure out how to get each time slot to be its own respective

color. I have the entire chart highlighting itself depending on the current time. 

If the current time is before 9:00, it is all highlighted green. If the current time is

between 9:00 and 18:00, it is highlighted red. If it's after 18:00, it's all highlighted green.

Because of the multiple hours spent on trying to figure this out, I wasn't able to get the 

display at the top to show the current time, or implement any of the bootstrap I had planned 

to add. This is why I feel so close yet so far. Not my best work, but not my worst either.
